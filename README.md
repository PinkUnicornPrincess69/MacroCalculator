Basic Macro Calculator

This is my first completed project! The aim was to be able to convert pounds into killograms and vice versa, I also wanted it to work out and calculate my daily macros as well as anyone else who wanted to work out theirs. 

Once it gathers information on the user and what their goal is, it will then work out the macros and if the user wants to save that infomation as well as the date into a file that the user can name. If the file already exists, it will then amend the file with the latest details, if the name doesn't exist, it will create the file.
